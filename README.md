**Personality Prediction using Machine Learning**
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person is an introvert or extrovert based on behavioural features such as time spent alone, event attendance, and social activity.

**FEATURES**
-->Cleans and preprocesses the personality dataset (mixed numerical and categorical features).
-->Trains a classification model (RandomForestClassifier) to predict personality type.
-->Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-->Saves the trained model to disk for later loading and inference.
